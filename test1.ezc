# Number guessing game
# The program will set a random number, and the player must guess it.

VARSET target 7        # Target number (hardcoded for this example)
VARSET attempts 0      # Counter for the number of attempts

PRINT                  # Prompt to enter the first guess
INPUT                  # Player inputs a guess
VARSET guess 0         # Store the input in a variable

VARSET win 0           # Flag for winning the game

# Loop start
VARGET guess           # Push the guess
VARGET target          # Push the target number
SUB                    # Subtract the target from the guess
PUSH 0                 # Push zero to compare
PRINT                  # Print Results
